## About the Application

FATEBOOK features a colored display for each tab. Time delays are incorporated for various actions. The application uses the system's current time. Users can have the same names, but each has a unique username. Mobile numbers must be 11 characters long and contain only digits (0-9). Passwords should be 6 characters long. A prefix tree is employed for efficient user search. The application handles exceptions and validations in line with "Facebook" standards.
